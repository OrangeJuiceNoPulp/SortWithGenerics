This program uses generic to allow the user to generate and sort a randomized array of a length specified by the user. (The default length is 10.)


The user can specify whether a "Student" in the randomly generated array has a "grade" using the Integer, Float, or Double datatype. (The default datatype is Integer.)

These objects are then sorted according to the value of their "grade".


The sorting algorithms used in this program are merge sort and bubble sort. Both of these sorting algorithms sort the array in place in this program.

The user will be able to choose which of the two sorting algorithms they would like to use. (Merge sort is the default sorting algorithm and is recommended for large array lengths.)


The user will also be given the option to print out both the randomly generated and sorted array. (The default is to not print out the arrays, and it is recommended to not print them out for large array lengths.)
